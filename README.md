<h2>Everything about asynchronous</h2>

I've covered this course [Link to the TalkPython course](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_async_python/async-in-python-with-threading-and-multiprocessing) and decided to share **notes** I made with the world:)

<h4>Repo structure</h4>

- there are folders divided by the topics covered in the course
- navigate to the folder where you can find both <ins>notes and code</ins>

**But which topics exactly were covered?**:
On the whole there were the following main chunks
1. do more <i>at once</i>: asyncio, threads
2. do things <i>faster</i>: multiprocessing, Cython
3. libraries to ease up written above: trio, unsync
4. async web framework as alternative to Flask: Quart
